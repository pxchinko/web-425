        <h4>Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky</h4>
        <br />
          <p>
            Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Tchaikovsky also spelled Chaikovsky, Chaikovskii, or Tschaikowsky,
            name in full Anglicized as Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky, (born April 25 [May 7, New Style], 1840, Votkinsk,
            Russiaâ€”died October 25 [November 6], 1893, St. Petersburg), the most popular Russian composer of all time.
            His music has always had great appeal for the general public in virtue of its tuneful, open-hearted melodies,
            impressive harmonies, and colourful, picturesque orchestration, all of which evoke a profound emotional response.
            His oeuvre includes 7 symphonies, 11 operas, 3 ballets, 5 suites, 3 piano concertos, a violin concerto,
            11 overtures (strictly speaking, 3 overtures and 8 single movement programmatic orchestral works), 4 cantatas,
            20 choral works, 3 string quartets, a string sextet, and more than 100 songs and piano pieces.
